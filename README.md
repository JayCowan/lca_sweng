# Binary Trees and Lowest Common Ancestor Implemented in Dart
A simple command-line application written in dart that lets you enter binary trees of `nums` (but would work for any type implementing `Comparable<T>`). The trees are split by relative value where left < parent and right >= parent in order of input.
The Tree should work for any type implementing `Comparable<T>` but has been tested for types inheriting `num`.

### Steps to Test:
1. Install the Dart SDK and command line tools from [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
2. From the terminal open to the lca_sweng directory
3. Run the `dart test` command to view test results
### Steps to Run:
1. Open a terminal to the lca_sweng directory.
2. From the terminal enter `dart run`
3. Follow instructions to build your tree and find a Lowest Common Ancestor
