A simple command-line application written in dart that lets you enter binary trees of `nums` (but would work for any type implementing `Comparable`). The trees are split by relative value where left < parent and right >= parent in order of input.
1. Open a terminal to the lca_sweng directory.
2. From the terminal enter `dart run`
3. Follow instructions to build your tree and find a Lowest Common Ancestor
